INTRODUCTION OF THE LINKED LIST :>

Linked List is a linear data structure,linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location, the elements are linked using pointers.
a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a value and a address part to the next node in the list.

Why Linked List? 
arrays have the following limitations:>

(1).    The size of the arrays is fixed.
(2).   insertion and deletion the new element in the array is expensive because the shifted operation we need          to do that.
(3).   Linked list allows for a dynamic size that can change at runtime.
(4).   Memory allocation: For arrays at compile time , and for linked lists at runtime.
(5).   Execution time:
                                 (i)some operations (such as modifying a certain element) are faster in arrays.
                                 (ii)such as inserting/deleting an element in the data are faster in linked lists.
