INTRODUCTION OF THE STACK  :-

Stack is a linear data structure , It maintains LIFO (last in first out) order . 

there are some operations like :
                       (1).   search
                       (2).  create
                       (3).  update
                      (4).   delete
                                           they all are happens in the constant time : O(1) time complexity.

stack methods :-
  
(i)      push ()        -      insertion .
(ii)     pop()           -      deletion .
(iii)    peek()          -      check the topmost element.
(iv)    isEmpty()    -      check the size of stack is empty or not.
(v)     size()           -      calculate the sie of size.
