INTRODUCTION OF QUEUE :-

A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO).
The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.

> in queue random access is not alllowed.
> insertion in the queue is happened in rear .
> deletion in the queue is happened in front.
